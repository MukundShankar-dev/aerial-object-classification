This computer vision model is based on YOLOv5.
It applies transfer learning to add a set of contextual data to the pretrained model and allow it to identify balloons in the air.

The code contained in the inference_balloons notebook was used to test the efficiency of the pretrained model and compare that to the performance of our model after applying transfer learning.

Sample outputs (before and after applying transfer learning) can be found in the sample_outputs folder.
